# 7. How to add more attributes for filtering launches in ReportPortal

There is also a possibility to filter by attributes. You can find an example of setting attributes in your [profile](/user-account/EditPersonalInformation). You can include them in the parameters of automation, then additional attributes will appear under the Launch name, and you can filter test executions by these attributes as well.

<media-view src={require('./img/ProfileAttributes.png')} alt="Attributes in Profile" />

<media-view src={require('./img/Attributes.png')} alt="Attributes for the Launch" />
