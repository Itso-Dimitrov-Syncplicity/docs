# 4. How to generate first data in ReportPortal

The main section for work with ReportPortal is Launches tab in the left menu. But Launches table is empty and it’s hard to understand what ReportPortal can do and what to do next.

[Generate demo data](/reportportal-configuration/ProjectConfiguration#demo-data) feature can help you with this, by generating a set of demo launches (test executions), filters and dashboards.

<media-view src={require('./img/GenerateFirstData.png')} alt="Generate First Data" />

Once generated, you will see 5 launches (each Launch is equivalent to a testing session, or testing execution, or one Jenkins job). On the Filters tab you will find 1 filter. And Dashboards will have a Demo dashboard with visualizations/widgets built on top of the data from launches.

Let’s understand how ReportPortal works based on demo data, and later we can return to the upload of your actual data from your testing frameworks. You can [navigate to this section](./HowToAddTestResultsToReportPortal) right now if you wish.
