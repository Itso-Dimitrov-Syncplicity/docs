# 10. How to use Pattern Analysis

[Pattern Analysis](/analysis/PatternAnalysis) feature helps to find static repeating patterns within automation. For example, you know that a 404 error in your application might be caused by a specific product bug. Create the rule with a problem phrase, launch a test run, and Pattern Analysis will find all failed items which have known patterns in error logs. This allows you to draw a quick conclusion.
