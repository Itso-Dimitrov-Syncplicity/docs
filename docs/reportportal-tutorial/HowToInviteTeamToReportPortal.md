# 3. How to invite Team to ReportPortal

Finally, you logged into ReportPortal. And you see just empty tabs... Looks confusing for the first step. What can we do to get started?

Letâ€™s start by inviting your team members. You can also do it as a final step, but it would be nice to investigate ReportPortal together.

In order to add other users to ReportPortal you can send invitations via email. To make sure that the Email service is configured, please follow the next steps (as an admin user): [E-mail server configuration](/plugins/EmailServer). Once emailing is configured, you can either [invite new users](/reportportal-configuration/CreationOfProjectAndAddingUsers#invite-a-user-to-a-project) or [create a new user](/reportportal-configuration/CreationOfProjectAndAddingUsers#add-users-to-project) in the project.

After this step you will have emailing capabilities enabled, and several more users invited to ReportPortal.
