# 16. How to add test results to ReportPortal

You have checked demo test results, dashboards and widgets. And now you want to see your real data in ReportPortal.

ReportPortal is a system that integrates with your Test Framework, listens to events and visualizes test results. You cannot execute results right from ReportPortal, but you can [integrate ReportPortal with a Test Framework](/log-data-in-reportportal/test-framework-integration/) or [Implement own integration](/log-data-in-reportportal/ImplementOwnIntegration).
