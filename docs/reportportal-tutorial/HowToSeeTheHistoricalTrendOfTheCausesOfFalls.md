# 12. How to see the historical trend of the causes of falls

And now let's build a more detailed “Launch statistics chart” widget with the historical changes in tests results. So, I can see how the results of my launches have changed over time.

**Use case**

Goal: Create a widget to show historical changes in Passed/Failed test cases in my API tests.

Follow the instructions below to create this [Launch statistics chart](/dashboards-and-widgets/LaunchStatisticsChart).

<media-view src={require('./img/HistoricalTrends1.png')} alt="Configure Launch statistics chart" />

Here you can see the historical distribution of your test results: there are Passed or Failed tests.

<media-view src={require('./img/HistoricalTrends2.png')} alt="Historical distribution of your test results" />

Instead of just Failed tests, you can see the dynamics of the total number of Product bugs, Automation bugs, System issues and No Defect.

<media-view src={require('./img/HistoricalTrends3.png')} alt="Failed test cases in details" />

In this way, you see the historical trend of the causes of falls.

<media-view src={require('./img/HistoricalTrends4.png')} alt="Historical trend of the causes of falls" />
