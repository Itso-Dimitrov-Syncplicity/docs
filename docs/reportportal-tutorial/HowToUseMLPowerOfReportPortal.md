# 9. How to use ML power of ReportPortal

[ML suggestions](/analysis/MLSuggestions) feature prompts similar tests and defect types they have. In this way we donâ€™t waste time re-reading the log but use ML hints instead.

ML suggestions analysis is running every time you enter "Make decision" editor. ML suggestions are executed for all test items no matter what defect type they currently have.
