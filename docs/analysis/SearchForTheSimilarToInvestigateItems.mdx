# Search for the similar "To investigate" items

**Use case:**

**Situation:** Analyzer has been finished its work, and marked with defect types known issues.

But in the run there are a lot of failures with a similar unknown reason. All such items have "To investigate" defect type.

**Problem:** A user should check and analyze all failed items.

**Solution:** A user is on All launches, he clicks on "To investigate" and opens a list with items. When a user clicks on a pencil near a defect type, the system opens a ["Make decision" modal](./ManualAnalysis#make-decision-modal-redesign). In this modal users can see all items with "To investigate" defect type and the same failure reason.

There are 3 options for search the similar "To investigate" items on the Step level:

- Current item only
- Similar "To investigate" in the launch & current item
- Similar "To investigate" in 10 launches & current item

There are 4 options for search the similar "To investigate" items on the Log level:

- Current item only
- Similar "To investigate" in the launch & current item
- Similar "To investigate" in 10 launches & current item
- "To investigate" from the history line & current item

If launches are filtered by filter on All Launches page, then addition option ```Similar "To investigate" in the Filter & current item``` appears on the Step and Log levels.
